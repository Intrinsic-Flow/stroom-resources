# This file contains a whitelist of environemnt variables to
# extract from the source docker compose yml file. In the source
# yml file you will see entries like:
# - XX_XX=${YY_YY:-some_default}
# In this example if you wanted the environment variable and its default to
# be included in the stack env file then you would add 'YY_YY' to this
# whitelist
# NOTE: Env vars listed here cannot also be in the overrides.env file
