# This is the stack version we want to install and use.
stack_version: v6.0-beta.51-2

# IDEA: we could define a 'previous_version' when we're migrating, and if it exists we could stop and delete
# before doing an install.

# We define a {{home}} variable because:
#  1. If we use '~/' then if we're elevating we'll install things in /root/ instead
#  2. We might want to change the user, in which case we'll only want to change it in one place.
home: /home/centos
